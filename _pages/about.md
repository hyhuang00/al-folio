I’m a final-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science at Duke University, under supervision of Prof. [Cynthia Rudin](https://users.cs.duke.edu/~cynthia/) and Prof. [Benjamin C. Lee](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~leebcc/). I’m interested in improving transparency and efficiency of current machine learning models. Prior to joining Duke, I received my Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Computer Science from the University of Michigan, where I worked with Prof. [Jenna Wiens](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~wiensj/).
